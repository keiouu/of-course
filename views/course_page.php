						      <h2>Teaching and assessment</h2>
						
						      <h4>Your Accounting and Finance modules</h4>
						      <p>Some modules have a number of workshops or sessions in computer laboratories. Most of your modules involve individual study using Library resources. Most modules have an end-of-year examination that contributes either 70% or 80% to the final module mark: your coursework provides the remaining marks. Both Stage 2 and 3 marks count towards your final degree class.</p>
						      <h4>Your Economics modules </h4>
						      <p>All Economics modules are taught by a combination of lectures and small group sessions, which include seminars, computing practicals, problem sets, debates and role-play games. We put great emphasis on the development of transferable skills, including numeracy, analytical problem solving, data analysis, and written and oral communication, as well as subject-specific skills for further study at postgraduate level. The modules are assessed by continuous assessment of coursework throughout the year and an end-of-year exam in the final term. A number of modules at each stage are assessed solely through coursework.</p>
